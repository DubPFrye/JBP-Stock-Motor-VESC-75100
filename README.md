# JBP-Stock-Motor-VESC-75100

these are the xml files I pulled from my VESC 75100 (yeah, the Flipsky one).

Hardware configuration to match these files:
-Jetson Bolt Pro, stock motor, stock throttle assy.
-Crapsky 75100 controller.
-Phase and Hall wires all connected color to color.
-White temperature write from motor connected to white 75100 temperature wire.
-Throttle power sourced from the 3.3V of the 75100.
-Throttle signal wire connected to ADC1
-48V (13S) battery with at least 50A of current sourcing ability.

VESC Tool and VESC firmware versions:
TBA.....
